# Understanding Merkle Trees: A Beginner's Guide

## What is a Merkle Tree?

A Merkle tree (also known as a hash tree) is like a family tree for data. Imagine you have a bunch of files or transactions, and you want an efficient way to verify if any of them have been tampered with. That's where Merkle trees come in!

## How Does it Work?

1. **Bottom Layer (Leaves)**
   - Take your data (files, transactions, etc.)
   - Calculate a hash for each piece of data
   - These hashes become the "leaves" of your tree

2. **Building Up**
   - Take pairs of hashes and combine them
   - Calculate a new hash of the combined values
   - Keep doing this until you reach a single hash (the "root")

```
Root Hash
    /\
   /  \
Hash   Hash
/\     /\
H1 H2  H3 H4
```

# Merkle Tree Implementation

This project implements a Merkle Tree in Rust. A Merkle Tree is a data structure used in cryptography and computer science to efficiently verify the integrity of data.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

- **src/main.rs**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the data for the Merkle tree, creates an instance of `MerkleTree`, and prints the Merkle root. It also calls the `visualize` method to generate a visualization of the Merkle tree.

- **src/merkle_tree.rs**: This file defines the `MerkleTree` struct and its associated methods, including creating a new Merkle tree, getting the root, visualizing the tree, generating a DOT representation, and building the Merkle graph.

- **src/lib.rs**: A library file that exposes the `MerkleTree` struct and its methods for use in other modules or projects.

- **Cargo.toml**: The configuration file for the Cargo package manager, specifying the project metadata, dependencies, and build settings.

## Building and Running the Project

To build and run the project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile the project and execute the main function, which will display the Merkle root and generate a visualization of the Merkle tree.

## Visualization

The visualization of the Merkle tree will be saved as a PNG file named `merkle_tree.png` in the `/out` directory. Make sure you have Graphviz installed to generate the visualization.
